	<p> my take on South Indian Sambar </p>
	<ul>
		<li> 2 cups red lentils</li>
		<li> 1 large broccoli, cut in florets</li>
		<li> 1 cauliflower, cut in florets</li>
		<li> 2 medium sized yellow or red onions, chopped</li>
		<li> 3-4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
		<li> 1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
		<li> 2 cups of fresh or frozen okras, sliced in two</li>
		<li> 1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
		<li> a handful of fresh coriander</li>
		<li> 1 cup of dry soya chunks, rehydrated</li>
		<li> 1 Tbsp turmeric </li>
		<li> 1 Tbsp of ground cumin </li>
		<li> 3 Tbsp Sambar Masala</li>
		<ul>*can be found in specialized indian supermarket or self made</ul>
		<li> 1 Tbsp ground coriander(1 c. à soupe)</li>
		<li> 1 Tbsp black mustard seeds (1 c. à soupe)</li>
		<li> Graines de cumin (1 c. à soupe)</li>
		<li> 2 cardamom pods (crushed with the side of a knife)</li>
		<li> 1 fresh chili, chopped finely, or chili flakes</li>
		<li> 1 tbsp tamarin paste (optional)</li>
		<li> 2 curry leaves (optional)</li>
		<li> 1/4 cup neutral vegetable oil or ghee</li>
	</ul>
	<ol> <b>Steps</b>
		<li>In a large pot, warm your oil or ghee at medium heat. Add mustard seeds,
			 cumin seeds, cardamom pods and curry leaves. Let the spices fry for a few
			 minutes until they are golden and release a good smell.</li>
		<li>Add onions to the pot and cook them, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add the garlic, ginger and chili to the pot. Let the mixture fry for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add the vegetables: brocoli, cauliflower and the chopped stems of the fresh coriander.
			Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add lentils and tomatoes. Then, add water to cover to make sure that lentils are well submurged.</li>
		<li>Add ground spices: turmeric, cumin, Sambar masala mix and coriander,
			as well as a good amount of salt and some black pepper.
			If you have tamarin paste, also add it at this point.</li>
		<li>Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to the minimum. Making sure it is simmering.</li>
		<li>When the letils are almost fully cooked, add the okras and the soya chunks.</li>
		<li>Taste and adjust the seasoning. Depending on the freshness and quality
			of your spices you might need to add more (old spices are less potent).</li>
		<li>Once the lentils are well cooked, you can close heating. </li>
		<li>Serve with chopped coriander leaves, and your side of choice (e.g.,
			rice, naan, dosa, idli, chapati or paratha).</li>
	</ol>
